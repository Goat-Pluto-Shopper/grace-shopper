# Goat Pluto Norms

## What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
- VOTE. If tied or sitll in disagreement, escalate to fellows.

## What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
- It's ok to step away; just make sure to come up with a plan to regroup (i.e. come back in 5 minutes).
- If code help: mention what the frustration is in slack - what problem are you dealing with?
- If it's an interpersonal issue, feel free to speak to fellow and have fellow address the group; or if comfortable, give feedback directly.
- OK to call each other out if one person is not pulling their weight. Taskmaster for the day can pull that person aside and have a one-on-one conversation.

## What does this group do when we merge our work together?
- Do we do it together? YES.
- Can notify each other to have a merge meeting - use slack.
- When working in pairs, the other pair can review the request.

## When does this group ask for help?
- Worth it for everyone in team to have a quick look. After 15 min being stuck , submit a help ticket.

## How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
- One pair a day.
- Pairs decide on their own when to switch - be open and honest about when tired.
- During morning standup, taskmaster decides on pairs and what tasks to do for the morning. As pairs finish tasks throughout the day, they can look at the board and pick another task.
- At EOD, let taskmaster know if any tasks are incomplete; push everything up anyway. You can continue on that task the next day if you wish, as long as you communicate it.

## How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?

- Fair game to work outside class, as long as everyone is notified on slack & you communicate with your pair programming partner.

## What time does this group have daily stand up?
- Starting at 10:30 (whenever REACTO ends,) we'll have our own standup meeting & assign roles (gitmaster, taskmaster, testmaster). Work on tasks, then report to Keyairra at 11:05.
- Multiple standups a day: One morning without Keyairra (10:30), one with Keyairra (11:05), one after lunch, one at end of day. During meetings, bring up current tasks, any issues, reviews that are ready to go, etc.
